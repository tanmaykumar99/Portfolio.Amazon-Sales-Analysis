# Amazon Prime Day 2025: Sales Analysis & Business Storytelling

## Executive Summary: A Tale of Two Customers

![Overview](../Power_BI/images/Overview.jpeg)

The Amazon Prime Day 2025 sale generated **₹3.19 Crores** in total sales over 8000+ products. This success is powered by a dual-engine growth model, catering to two critical customer types: **volume-driven deal seekers** and **value-driven premium buyers**. Promotions drive traffic and sales volume, while high-value, full-priced items—especially in Electronics and Large Appliances—deliver substantial revenue per transaction.

## Dual-Engine Growth Model

### Engine #1: The Volume Driver (Discount Seekers)

![By Discount](../Power_BI/images/by_discount.png)

- **Discounted products** account for **5,517 units sold** and **₹1.78 Crores** in revenue (More than 50% of total).
- **Business Impact:** Promotions capture price-sensitive customers and drive volume.
- **Customer Perception:** Discounts **do not reduce ratings**; both discounted and non-discounted items have an average rating of **~3.92**.

> **Recommendation:** Continue broad discount campaigns for volume; customer satisfaction remains unchanged, but can be improved. A further sentimental analysis on the reviews should be carried out to see where exactly the shortcomings are, and a possible outreach, coupled with stricter checks on the suppliers and third-party sellers should be in the cards.

### Engine #2: The Value Driver (Premium Buyers)

- **Electronics:** Generates **₹1.51 Crores** sales; **average sale ₹12,277**.

- **Large Appliances:** **₹0.80 Crores** sales; **average sale ₹18,826**, top average rating (**3.98**).

> **Recommendation:** Avoid heavy discounting on premium products; offer value-adds like attractive EMI offers, warranties, installation, or bundles (wherever possible).

### 2. Logistics Optimization: Unlock Warehouse Potential

![Max Sales Year_est](../Power_BI/images/sales_by_year_est.png)

- **2018 Warehouses:** Peak year—**₹57.49 Lakhs**.

![Sales by Warehouse Size](../Power_BI/images/sales_by_wareh_size.png)

- **Warehouse Size:** Medium—**₹1.42 Cr**; Small—**₹1.1 Cr**; Large—**₹0.65 Cr** (underperformer).

![Sales by Warehouse Type](../Power_BI/images/warehouse_type_breakdown.png)

- **Warehouse Type:** Mega FC—**₹2.06 Cr** sales; Average sale **₹3,687**.  
    Last-Mile Hub—**₹0.37 Cr** sales; Average sale **₹3,992**.

> **Actions:**
> - **Replicate Best Practices:** Analyze why 2018, medium-sized warehouses excel; adopt across all network.
> - **Audit Large Warehouses:** Investigate low sales, inventory, processes, and costs. Get in touch with Warehouse and Logistic Department.
> - **Optimize Inventory Strategy:** Stock discounted goods in Mega FCs, premium items in Last-Mile Hubs for fast, high-quality delivery of in-demand goods for optimum growth in sales and subsequent revenue.

NOTE: It is interesting to observe the discrepancy between the data for large warehouses being so low, yet the Mega FCs boasting the highest sales. This could lead to the conclusion that the Mega FC title is not just obtained based on size of an Amazon warehouse, but on other factors like location said warehouse caters to the most, its historical performance, constituent warehouse team, etc., in which case this would not qualify as a discrepancy at all, but if size is the only factor here, this could be pointing to a much bigger issue at hand, one of which is potentially a corrupted and/or mismatched data collection. A deeper dive is necessary to eliminate these questions before proceeding to making informed business decisions.
